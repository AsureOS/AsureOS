AsureOS is a custom iso project that got rid of telemetry and useless components that come with Windows. With this method, it provides the players with the maximum performance and low latency that they can get from their computers with the automatic tweaking script included. Since it is open source, you can use AsureOS with peace of mind.

Please check the functions and features that the project doesn't support before downloading.
